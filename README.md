# Locust-Detection-using-Swarm-Drones
This project involves the development of a swarm drone system that can detect and eliminate locusts in farms using object detection and spraying of pesticides. 
Locust infestations pose a significant threat to agriculture, resulting in substantial economic losses worldwide. To address this problem, a swarm drone system has been proposed that can identify and eliminate locusts in farms quickly and efficiently. The proposed system integrates object detection and spraying of pesticides using a swarm of drones to increase the overall efficiency of the process.

For the object detection part, the system uses a YOLOv8 algorithm, which is a CNN model. The algorithm can identify locusts in the farm and determine their location, size, and orientation. This information is then used to guide the swarm of drones to the affected areas.

The swarm drones are controlled by the ArduPilot system, which enables them to work together effectively. The ArduPilot system allows the drones to communicate with each other and coordinate their movements to cover a more significant area in less time. The drones use the information obtained from the YOLOv8 algorithm to navigate to the infested areas and spray the pesticides accurately.

The proposed system has the potential to increase the efficiency and accuracy of locust detection and eradication. The system can cover a more significant area in less time, reducing the overall cost of the operation. By eliminating the locusts quickly, the proposed system can minimize crop damage and increase yields, resulting in substantial economic benefits.

Moreover, the use of swarm drones and AI-based algorithms is a step forward towards automation in agriculture. This system can further pave the way for other similar applications that use drones for crop monitoring and disease control.
